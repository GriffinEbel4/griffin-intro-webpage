<h1> Getting to Know Griffin</h1>
<center><img src="ebel_griffin.jpg"></center>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p1> Hi, my name is Griffin Ebel, and I am currently a sophomore. I have lived in New Lenox my entire life and was born just around the corner in Palos. My major here at Lewis is unmanned aviation systems and I have loved almost every course I have taken thus far. </p1>
<h3>My Favorite Hobbies</h3>
<p1>My favorite hobby is either cooking or hiking. It is too difficult for me just to choose one as both bring me so much joy. I enjoy cooking as it allows for me to have a creative outlet where I can experiment and have an enjoyable result. On the other hand, I love activities such as hiking and camping as I have always loved nature and being emerged in it gives me a sense of peace. </p1>
<h3>Why I am taking Taking Programming Fundamentals</h3>
<p1>I am taking this course not only because it is the next step in major progression but also because I found that I really enjoy coding after taking introduction to computer science. I hope to  further advance my familiarity with programming throughout this course as well as decide if I want to commit to a computer science major. </p1>
